        <li><h2>Anchor Tags</h2></li>
        <p>Anchor tags in HTML code are HTML elements used to create hyperlinks in webpages. They allow you to link to another webpage, a specific section of a page, an email address, a file, or any other URL.</p>

        <li><h2>Meta Tags</h2></li>
        <p>Metadata is data (information) about data. meta tags always go inside the head element, and are typically used to specify character set, page description, keywords, author of the document, and viewport settings. Metadata will not be displayed on the page, but is machine parsable.</p>
